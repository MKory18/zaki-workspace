/**
 * «متأخر» in the departments list is a COMPANY day, like everywhere else (Phase B of the review).
 *
 * `loadAnalytics`, My Work, the Today page and «كل المساحات» all compare a due date with the START
 * of the company's today (`zonedDayStart`, `Organization.timezone`). `listDepartments` compared it
 * with the machine's wall clock instead: a task due at 09:00 today showed as «متأخرة» at noon, so
 * one screen and the next disagreed about the same task, and the number moved with the server's
 * clock rather than with the work.
 *
 * The service takes `now` so the test can pin the day (the same shape as `loadAnalytics`).
