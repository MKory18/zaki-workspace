/**
 * B6 (Phase B review, fixed in Phase E): «متأخرة» is one question with one answer.
 *
 * My Work, the Today page and the reports measure a task against the START of the company's today
 * (`Organization.timezone`). Two other paths measured against the server's wall clock — the list
 * route's `?overdue=true` and the views query's fallback when a caller forgot the line — so the same
 * task due at 09:00 today was "today" on one screen and "overdue" on the next after noon.
