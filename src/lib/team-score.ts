/**
 * «السكور» — THE PURE PART: periods, the normalisation of every indicator to 0-100, the weighted average and the bands.
 * No React, no Next, no database: the service reads the numbers, this file does the arithmetic, the screen prints the
 * formula from the SAME constants, and the tests pin fixed fixtures.
 *
 * THE RULES (each is printed on the screen next to its number):
 *
 *  - A score belongs to ONE person and ONE period: a calendar month («2026-10») or quarter («2026-Q4»).
 *  - Four indicators feed it, each normalised to 0-100:
 *      المراجعات (manual)   the reviewers' ratings 1-5, averaged per review and then over the reviews that count:
 *                           (average − 1) ÷ 4 × 100.
 *      الالتزام بالموعد     the on-time rate of the tasks finished in the period that had a due day, as it is (50% = 50).
 *      الإنجاز             tasks finished in the period ÷ the person's BASELINE × 100, never more than 100.
 *      الخطوات             steps ticked in the period ÷ the person's BASELINE × 100, never more than 100.
 *    The baseline is the median of the person's own last 3 periods in which they finished something (steps: ticked
 *    something); when there is no such period, the team's median for THIS period (only when at least 3 people have a number).
 *  - NEVER INVENT: an indicator with nothing to compute from is left out and shown as «—»; the weights of the ones that
 *    remain are re-normalised to 100%.
 *  - The composite is the weighted average of the present indicators; the weights are the owner's (default 50 / 20 / 20 / 10).
 *  - Bands: ممتاز from 80, جيد from 60, يحتاج دعم below. The suggested light: تمام from 70, انتبه from 50, يحتاج تدخل below.
 *    ⚠️ The light that counts is the reviewer's own; the system only SUGGESTS one and says so.
 *  - Shown beside the score but never part of it: tasks still open and overdue NOW, the number of chat messages (a count,
 *    never their text) and the time tracked. A number is not a judgement of quality.
