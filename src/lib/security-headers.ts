/**
 * The headers every response carries (security review D3).
 *
 * Nothing set them before: the app could be framed by any site (a fake sign-in laid over ours, or
 * «offboard this person» clicked under a finger), a browser guessed a type it was not told, and the
 * address of a page — ids, `?next=`, a registration token — travelled to every site a link led to.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT a full Content-Security-Policy: a strict one needs a nonce on every inline script
 * Next writes, and a wrong one blanks the app. These directives are the ones that cannot break it:
 *  - `frame-ancestors 'self'` (with X-Frame-Options SAMEORIGIN for older browsers): the file preview
 *    frames its OWN PDF, so 'self' — never 'none' — and no other site may frame us;
 *  - `base-uri 'self'`: an injected <base> cannot move every relative address to another site;
 *  - `form-action 'self'`: a form cannot post a password elsewhere.
 * Camera and microphone stay allowed for this site only: calls need them.
