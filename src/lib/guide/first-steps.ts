/**
 * The first-steps card for a new account («خطواتك الأولى»): which steps exist, for whom, and how
 * the card reads their state. A pure module; the facts that decide a step come from the database
 * (src/server/services/first-steps.ts) and the rest from the device (src/lib/guide/storage.ts).
 *
 * Each step has:
 *   audience       who it applies to - a guest is never asked to add a task, only a people manager
 *                  is asked to add a person
 *   availableFrom  the phase of the product in which the step exists. Only the steps whose phase has
 *                  come are shown, so a later phase adds its steps here (e.g. «ابعت أول رسالة» with
 *                  the chat of phase 3) without anything to switch off today.
 *   fact           what decides it from real data, or nothing: then the DEVICE decides (the app was
 *                  installed on this phone, the guide was opened here)
 *   manual         the person may also confirm it by hand with «تم»
