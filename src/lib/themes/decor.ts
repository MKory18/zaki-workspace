/**
 * DECORATION — what each theme draws, in the four places it is allowed.
 *
 * A pure module (no React, no DOM, no server imports): the component, the generator script and the tests all
 * read the layers, the files and the numbers from here. The stylesheet is GENERATED from it
 * (`renderDecorCss()` -> `scripts/build-decor-css.mjs` -> `src/components/theme/decor.css`, committed;
 * `tests/themes-decor-css.test.ts` fails when the two differ).
 *
 * Ported from the OMS decoration engine (`theme-decoration.ts` / `theme-shape.ts` there): the IDEAS and the
 * measured NUMBERS are the same, the code is adapted to this stack — the theme is the `data-theme` attribute of
 * <html>, the level is `data-decor`, and every colour is an RGB-triplet variable (`rgb(var(--accent) / .12)`).
 *
 * ── THE RULE THE OWNER DREW HIMSELF ──
 *
 *   ⚠️ NEVER BEHIND A NUMBER, AN AMOUNT OR A TABLE.
 *
 * A glow under a column of figures is a glow somebody reads through, every row, all day. So there are exactly
 * four places, the four where nothing is being measured or decided:
 *
 *   door     sign-in, the first-run set-up and the onboarding: the whole screen behind a calm card.
 *   empty    behind the sentence of a list that has nothing in it yet (~320 px, centred).
 *   sidebar  the 72 px header of the navigation (a corner, turned).
 *   strip    the thin hero strip of the Today page.
 *
 * `tests/themes-decor-guards.test.ts` sweeps the source for a fifth place and for any screen of figures that
 * draws one. And text over a photograph is ALWAYS on a scrim: the pictures are mood, the colour under the words
 * is the page's own (`tests/themes-decor-readable.test.ts` holds the words against the worst picture there could
 * be, through the very numbers below).
 *
 * ── LEVELS (the cookie `zk-decor`, <html data-decor>) ──
 *
 *   off    draws nothing: the layer is `display: none`, so no picture is even requested.
 *   light  (the default) static washes and ornament. Nothing moves, so there is nothing for reduced motion to
 *          switch off and nothing for a hidden tab to waste a frame on.
 *   full   adds one slow motion: a 24 s drift (night, day), a 420 s turn of the door's rosette (epic), a
 *          70 s zoom of the door photograph (neon coast). `prefers-reduced-motion` REMOVES it (not slows it), and
 *          a hidden tab pauses it (`watchDecorVisibility`, a `data-decor-hidden` attribute the stylesheet reads).
 *
 * ── WHAT EACH THEME WEARS ──
 *
 *   night, day                   a PATTERN of eight-pointed stars, drawn in code (an SVG tile written into the
 *                                sheet, no file on the disk), painted in the star's gold (`accent-2`) through a
 *                                CSS mask: «نجمة وطريق», the owner's adopted look. A tile repeats without an edge,
 *                                so the layer may drift.
 *   islamic-epic                 three MASKS — rosette, corner, skyline — white on transparent, painted in the
 *                                theme's accent through CSS `mask`: shape only, never a colour of its own. A
 *                                composed theme turns its rosette; it does not drift (a drift would show a seam of
 *                                background along the edges the corners and the roofline are anchored to).
 *   neon-coast                   three opaque PHOTOGRAPHS (the owner's own generations) under a veil made of the
 *                                theme's surface colour. A photograph does not drift either; the door zooms from
 *                                its centre, which cannot uncover an edge. The door's text column becomes a panel.
 *
 * ── RTL ──
 *
 * The product is Arabic and right-to-left only (`<html dir="rtl">`): "start" is the RIGHT edge. The corners are
 * drawn at the top right and turned for the left; a veil is heaviest at the right, where the words begin.

 *     and a test composites the worst picture there could be (pure white) and the brightest region of the real
 *     files through these numbers.

 *            a panel of `panel` alpha, and THAT, not the picture, is what every word is read against.
