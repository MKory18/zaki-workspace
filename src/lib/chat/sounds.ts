/**
 * THE CHAT'S SOUNDS (the owner, 2026-10-30: «الأصوات للدردشات، إرسال الرسائل…»): a soft pop when a message of mine
 * goes, another when somebody else's arrives in the conversation that is open, and the arrival pop twice when it
 * mentions me. They are small files under public/sounds (CC0, credited in public/brand/CREDITS.md), played by the
 * browser and nothing else: no server is told, so the owner's silent reading is not touched by them.
 *
 * Each person can switch them off (a button in the conversation's head); the choice stays in this browser. A
 * browser may refuse to play before the person has touched the page: then nothing plays and nothing breaks.
