/**
 * THE RECURRENCE JOB («مهمة متكررة», mode «حسب الجدول»): every series whose day has come makes its next task ONCE.
 *
 * Exactly once, however many processes or overlapping runs there are — the same discipline as the reminders: a due series
 * is CLAIMED by `UPDATE ... WHERE active AND nextDueAt <= now RETURNING ...` inside one transaction. A second run that
 * reaches the same row waits for the first to commit, re-reads it, finds `nextDueAt` already moved to the future and
 * claims nothing. The task, the copied steps and the new `nextDueAt` are written in that same transaction.
 *
 *  - a runner that was down for days makes ONE task (the latest occurrence that has passed), never one per missed day,
 *    and `nextDueAt` jumps to the first occurrence after now;
 *  - the task is made even when the previous occurrence is still open (the series is on a schedule, not waiting for the
 *    last one), unless an open occurrence of the series is not yet due — then there is already one to do and none is added;
 *  - past the end date the series stops (`ENDED`), after making the last task that falls on or before it;
 *  - a series whose space, project or board is archived or gone, or whose maker is no longer ACTIVE, is stopped with that reason;
 *  - a company that switched «المهام المتكررة» off: its series are not even selected; they wait and are due when it is back;
 *  - one series that fails is logged and left; it never blocks the others.
