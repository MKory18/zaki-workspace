 * The number on «الدردشة» in the menus: messages waiting for me, in ONE query.
 *
 * - Only conversations I have a row in (I wrote, read or joined there; my DMs): a topic I never opened
 *   is the chat home's business, and counting a company's whole history would make the badge useless.
 * - Never my own messages, deleted ones, or system lines («انضم»، «ثبّت»).
 * - A topic counts only while I am still in its space (rows outlive leaving it); the OWNER's rows are
 *   the topics he joined and his own DMs, so his silent oversight never adds anything.
 * - A guest: topics only.
 * - A topic of a «مقطع» counts for its people and the space's managers only (the same rule as `canRead`).
 * - Inside a space (`spaceId`, the space the person is in): that space's topics and DMs — and in «الشركة»
 *   (`legacyHere`) the DMs from before spaces had them. Another space's are on the space switcher instead
 *   (`unreadBySpace`).
