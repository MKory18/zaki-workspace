/**
 * «الأداء والتطوير» — WHO MAY READ AND WRITE WHAT, in one place. Every page and every route of the feature asks
 * `devAccess` and nothing else; a service never decides access on its own.
 *
 *   owner        the OWNER rank (the primary owner and his partners: `actor.isOwner`): every person, every record, silently
 *                (reading leaves no audit row, no notification, no «seen»).
 *   supervisor   anybody with at least one ACTIVE report: READS their subtree (direct and indirect) whatever their rank is.
 *                ENTERING anything about somebody else (skills, reviews, plans, notes) also needs `people.review`.
 *   lines        `people.manage_lines` («الهيكل»): sets who answers to whom and keeps the skills checklist. It reads the
 *                tree of names, never a score or a review.
 *   self         every staff member: their own skills (both columns), their own SHARED reviews and notes, their own plan and
 *                score. Never another person's.
 *   nobody       an external partner (a guest), or the company with the feature switched off.
 *
 * ⚠️ Whoever is outside their reach gets 404, never 403: a link to somebody else's page does not even say it exists.
 * 🔧 `reach` is what every screen and route checks a person id against. A person's own supervisor reads them whatever the
 *    supervisor's rank is: the line is data (`managerId`), not a rank comparison. Suspended and offboarded people are not in a
 *    supervisor's reach: their history is the owner's alone.
