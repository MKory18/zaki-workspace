 * «لوحة المالك» — WHO MAY READ WHAT, in one place. Every page and every route of the board asks `boardAccess` and nothing else.
 *
 *   owner   the OWNER rank (the primary owner and his partners: `actor.isOwner`): every person, every space, the company's
 *           totals and the «اليوم» strip. Reading leaves no trace, like all owner reading.
 *   team    holds `board.team` («لوحة الفريق», off until the owner switches it on for a person): the people of the spaces
 *           they manage (space ADMIN, or an org ADMIN who is in it) and of the teams they lead, and ONLY the work that
 *           happened in those spaces / teams. Never the owner's own page, never a partner's, never a guest's, no company
 *           totals. They also read their own page when they hold `board.self`.
 *   self    holds `board.self` («لوحتي», on for every staff rank): their own page, nobody else's, no totals.
 *   nobody  an external partner (a guest), a person holding neither switch, or the company with the feature switched off.
 *
 * ⚠️ Whoever is outside their reach gets 404, never 403: a link to somebody else's page does not even say it exists.
 * 🔧 `reach` is what the screens and routes check a person id against; `scope` is what every query is limited to.
