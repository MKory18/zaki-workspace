 * «مهمة بمكافأة» — who may touch a task that carries a reward. ONE function, called from the service layer, so every door

 *
 * The OWNER rank alone (every OWNER of the company, the co-owners with him) creates a reward, edits it or the title,
 * description or day of a reward task, cancels it, archives or deletes the task. Everybody else may see it, comment, tick
 * its steps and move it between columns (finishing it is how the reward is earned). Assigning people keeps its own rule
 * (src/server/services/task-assign.ts).
 *
 * Pure: the callers hand in whether the actor is an owner (read from the database, never from a cookie).
