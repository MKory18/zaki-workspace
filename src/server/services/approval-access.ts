/**
 * «طلبات الموافقة» — WHO MAY DO WHAT, in one place. Every route, page and service of approvals and forms asks here.
 *
 *   the switch   `approvals` in «الميزات»: off, nothing answers (404 `features.off`) for anybody, the owner included.
 *   a guest      an external partner never creates, sees or is asked (403 `guest.no_access`); the amount never reaches them
 *                because nothing does.
 *   in a space   a request belongs to ONE space. Only people who work in it (a row in the space that is not a guest's, an
 *                ACTIVE organization membership) can ask, be asked or read; the OWNER reads every space without a row.
 *   a reader     the requester, a person named in the chain, the space's managers (its ADMIN, an org ADMIN who is in it) and
 *                the OWNER. Anybody else gets 404, never 403: a link says nothing.
 *   a decider    ONLY the named approver whose turn it is. The owner reading silently decides nothing unless he is that
 *                approver: then he decides as himself, like anybody.
 *
 * ⚠️ Rank, status and the space row are read from the database on every call, never from the cookie.
