/**
 * The first-steps card («خطواتك الأولى») computed from REAL data for the signed-in actor: nothing is
 * stored about "progress" - a step is done because the rows say so (a theme chosen, a task created,
 * a task of theirs finished, a colleague added, a space they can open, a chat message they wrote). A step is never ticked by
 * somebody else's work or by a row the person cannot see: tests/db/first-steps-scope.test.ts.
 *
 *  - Which steps apply is decided by the registry (src/lib/guide/first-steps.ts): by the actor's
 *    level (a guest is never asked to add a task, only a people manager to add a person) and by the
 *    phase the step exists in.
 *  - Everything is scoped to the organization the actor works in now, never to another one.
 *  - Only the facts the actor's steps need are read (a guest costs one query).
 *  - The steps the DEVICE decides (the app installed on this phone, the guide opened here) come back
 *    not done: the card reads them from the device. What leaves here is plain keys and flags - no id,
 *    no row.
