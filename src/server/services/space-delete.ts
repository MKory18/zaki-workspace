/**
 * DELETING A SPACE WITH ALL ITS WORK (the owner's decision, 2026-10-26: «كلها مع شغلها»). The OWNER only, after typing
 * the space's name. Everything that lives in it goes, for good, in one transaction — nothing is left half-deleted:
 * its tasks and projects (boards, columns, comments with them), its conversations (topics and DMs, their messages,
 * boards and calls), its ideas, goals, routines, customers and opportunities, its notifications; its library files
 * are deleted the way the library deletes them (`deletedAt`). Its members and «مقاطع» go with the space.
 *
 * Never «الشركة» (HQ: the company's own talk), and never a department's space (it goes with its department).
 * A space without work is still deleted by its ADMINs through `DELETE /api/workspaces/[id]` (`deleteEmptyWorkspace`).
